#### Learning Elixir
I've decided to study Elixir to learn more about functional programming and its advantages.<br>
It's been a good experience so far, can't wait to start building projects with Phoenix.<br><br>


<h5> Notes:<h5>
  <h6>One of the best decisions I've ever made. A language that gives you power to control more closely the processes involved in your aplications is definately something you should Try.<br><br>
  Took me 3 days to finish Alura's "Elixir formation", also made my first CRUD using phoenix on the third day using some tutorials on YouTube.<br>
  It's only the beggining. Will keep this repo on github just in case someone interested in hiring a begginer or share some knowledge shows up.<br>
  Please send me a message even if you just want to talk about Elixir. It's always good to share and learn new stuff. :D
